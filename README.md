## Notebook: Data Manipulation and EDA
Data Manipulation in Python - CSV and Json
Download the Guerry dataset, a collection of historical data used in support of Andre-Michel Guerryâ€™s 1833 Essay on the Moral Statistics of France. 
The data set is hosted online in comma-separated values format (CSV) by the Rdatasets repository. 
We could download the file locally and then load it using read_csv.
The link for the dataset in CSV format: https://www.datavis.ca/gallery/guerry/guerry.csv

Cleaning, merging and analyzing business data with Python - Multiple CSV
ABC Bank has provided us with a dataset that contains customer details for their customers in BankAttrition - Details.csv file. 
The transactions related information and what kind of credit card the customer holds is provided to us in another file Transaction and Card Details.csv. 
The bank is currently facing problems of customer attrition. 
They have consulted us to understand how can they understand the patterns of customer attrition and if they can get early signals so to stop losing customers.


## Notebook: Basic ML Models, Validation strategies, Feature Engineering 
Till now: Merged data, performed exploratory data analysis(Continuation from previous notebook)
Agenda:
Basic data cleaning - One Hot Encoding, Feature Scaling
Train - test split
Distance-based Models (kNN)
Accuracy Metrics
Validation Strategies (Validation Set)
Cross - Validation
Linear Models (Linear Regression/Logistic Regression)
Model improvement stratgies: Impact of Feature Engineering/Feature Selection, missing value imputation, cleaning/capping outliers, balancing target categories (oversampling/SMOTE)
Tree-based models (if time permits)
